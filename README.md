# Battleship
It's Battleship! This one-player version allows you to go up against an AI that can strategically guess the locations of your ships.

When selecting where to place your ships, type the letter first then the number, ex. "A4"
You will then have the option of placing it horizontally or vertically (you may type "h" for horizontal or "v" for vertical).
The location of the coordinate you entered will either be the leftmost point or the top-most point of the ship depending on the chosen orientation.

Ships cannot be too close together. No two ships may have a point within one radial distance of each other.
A radial distance from a point is defined to be all 8 points forming a box around that point.

Good luck!
